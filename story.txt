Once upon a time there was a guy named Bob. He spent a lot of time in the Amazon Rainforest. He 
liked to stroll around in the forest everyday. Spending time with the monkeys was one of his 
favorite things to do. 

with the monkeys he would do things like eat bananas, and pick bugs out of there back. he was
basically tarzan. Bobs real reason for being in the rainforest was to study the habits of the monkeys
and how they interected with each other
